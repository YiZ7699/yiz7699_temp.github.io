# About me

----

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Southern California, who is interested in virtual network embedding, multi-agent systems, pathfinding, heuristic search, planning and scheduling techniques, optimization, robotics, machine learning, and artifical intelligence. 

My research focuses on developing scalable algorithms for solving the Virtual Network Embedding problem and the Multi-Agent Pathfinding problem efficiently and effectly. I am also intrested in building pathfinding system for planning robot motions.

2020: 
Won overall **1st place** in both rounds of the **NeurIPS-20 Flatland Challenge**, a railway scheduling competition which was held in partnership with German and Swiss railway companies. We outperformed all other entries in both tracks, including all reinforcement learning entries. According to the organizers, there were more than 700 participants from 51 countries making more than 2,000 submissions, [here for the USC press release](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2021/03/making-the-virtual-trains-run-on-time-usc-team-world-champs-in-ai-challenge/).
